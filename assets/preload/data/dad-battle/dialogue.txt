:dad:2:Alright, cut the bullshit.
:dad:22:What's the actual reason you two have been meeting up?
:gf:14:...
:bf:3:You see, sir...
:bf:12:Your daughter wanted me to help her convince you that she's cut out for the business.
:bf:5:So we've been meeting up doing little training sessions!
:dad:19:...What kind of training?
:bf:5:Uh... like shooting?
:sound: :BANG!
:bf:7:S-sir???
:gf:12:Daddy, why did you try to shoot him?!
:gf:9:And why do you even have a gun?!
:dad:22:Gah, you think you're hot stuff? Even dodging my bullet.
:dad:2:Well, if you can beat me here...
:dad:10:Only then will I even CONSIDER letting you date my daughter and have her become a part of this business, boy.

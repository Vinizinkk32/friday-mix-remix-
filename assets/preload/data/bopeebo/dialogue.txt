:dad:15:Alright, seems like all the required tasks I gave you are done for the week. Good work.
:dad:19:Let's start the debriefing-
:bf:3:A-actually sir, something urgent came up again. Would you mind if I deal with this?
:bf:5:I'll come back for the debriefing after!
:dad:20:...
:dad:19:Alright, fine. Be quick.
:bf:6:Thank you, sir!
:bf:1:I'll get going then. I'll try to be as quick as possible, sir!
:dad:21:...
:bf:6:Girlfriend! Hey!
:gf:13:Boyfriend! You made it!
:bf:6:Yeah, think your dad is in a good mood lately.
:bf:12:Considering he didn't question why I needed to go this time. (I wonder why...)
:bf:8:I gotta go back afterwards though, so I hope you don't mind us doing this a bit shorter.
:gf:6:That's totally fine!
:gf:4:Well, are you ready?
:bf:20:Totally, babe.
:gf:13:Hehe, alright! Let's start the music-
:dad:22:What did you just call my daughter?
:bf:7:Boss?!
:gf:12:Daddy?!
:dad:19:So, this was that "urgent" thing, boy?
:dad:2:You both got some explaining to do.
:dad:22:Now.
:bf:19:W-well... um-
:dad:17:He didn't do anything to you, did he, sweetie?
:dad:22:I'm ready to fire him right now if he did.
:bf:17:What- hey!
:gf:17:No, he didn't do anything to me!
:gf:9:We've just been...
:gf:18:meeting up... with each other.
:dad:22:And for what reason are you two doing so?
:gf:9:W-well...
:gf:18:B-because...
:gf:16:Because we're...
:bf:18:I'm dating your daughter... and another reason... sir.
:dad:3:...
:gf:14:...
:bf:14:...
:dad:4:HAHAHAHAHA!
:dad:18:Good one, boy!
:dad:4:HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
:bf:14:...
:gf:14:...
:dad:22:Wait. You're serious?
:dad:9:So, this is where you've been running to this entire time?
:dad:12:Seeing my daughter behind my back, boy?
:bf:19:W-we've just been singing sir!
:dad:8:Hah! You think you can just sing with my daughter like that?
:dad:10:If you want to date her...
:bf:13:...
:dad:18:You're going to have to go through ME first!
:bf:16:Wha-
:bf:19:A microphone? I thought you were going to-
:dad:7:Well, I still haven't heard your "other reason" for meeting up with my daughter.
:bf:3:...So, you sing?
:dad:6:It runs in the family.
:dad:10:Guess I'll show you what happens when you underestimate me, boy.
